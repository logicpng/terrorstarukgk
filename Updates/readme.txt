This is the beta release of Aster Terror Star! Thank you for volunteering to help me test it in advance!

What is done:

- The core "story", including random dialogue, longer monologues, and mechanisms to unlock more dialogues over time.
- Basic music playback through drag-n-drop
- Responses to some unusual files (such as My Computer or Recycling Bin shortcuts)
- Main menu, with options to disable waiting if you wish to go through the story faster for testing purposes (but it would be welcome if you could test if the waiting times need tweaking)
- Optional interaction with Aster Assistant Software at specific points
- Responses to being petted
- Responses to being uninstalled

What isn't done:

- Responses to all other kinds of files being dragged-n-dropped
- Dialogue for some "meta" events, like installing other ghosts and items
- Responses to being clicked on places besides shoulders
- Some other minor stuff to expand on the experience

I am looking for feedback on the quality of dialogue, flow of the "story", and any potential errors that can cause issues for end users who are not familiar with SSP.

Please remember that I am not a native English speaker, so the dialogue may have awkward turns of speech. Please let me know of better options if necessary!

If anything goes off the rails or if there are any grammatical and spelling errors that need to be fixed, please let me know!
